     Architecture and Framework for IPv6 over Non-Broadcast Access"
           draft-thubert-non-broadcast-access-architecture-00

Abstract

   This document presents an architecture for IPv6 over modern Non-
   Broadcast / Non-Transitive networks that decouples the physical
   concepts of interface, link and broadcast domain from the IP concepts
   of Interface, Link and Subnet, with the primary goal to apply on
   networks where broadcast is undesirable.  A study of the issues with
   classical ND over wireless media is presented, and a framework to
   solve those issues within the new architecture is proposed.

1.  Introduction

   IEEE Std. 802.1 [IEEE Std. 802.1] Ethernet Bridging provides an
   efficient and reliable broadcast service for wired networks;
   applications and protocols have been built that heavily depend on
   that feature for their core operation.  Unfortunately, Low-Power
   Lossy Networks (LLNs) and Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)
   generally do not benefit from the same reliable and cheap broadcast
   capabilities as Ethernet links.

   Similarly, the use of broadcast is discouraged on large scale virtual
   networks that are overlaid over distributed physical locations as
   meshes of point-to-point (P2P) links, as it represents massive
   amounts of replication.  All in all, as IPv6 Links migrate from a
   physical wire to virtual or intangible media, modern networks exhibit
   the common requirement to decouple physical properties such as
   broadcast capabilities and transitivity that are perceived and
   handled at the lower layers from the abstractions that are
   manipulated at the IP layer.

   This document presents an architecture for IPv6 over modern Non-
   Broadcast / Non-Transitive networks that decouples the lower-layer
   concepts of links and broadcast domains from the IP concepts of Links
   and Subnets.  A study of the issues with classical ND over wireless
   media is presented, and a framework to solve those issues within the
   new architecture is proposed.

2.  Issues with IPv6 ND-Based Access

2.1.  ND-Classic and ND-Proxies

   Though ND-Classic was the state of the art when designed for an
   Ethernet wire at the end of the twentieth century, it must be
   reevaluated for the new technologies, such as wireless and overlays,
   that evolved since then.  In particular, relying on broadcast
   operation may be inefficient (too many replications over constrained
   links), unreliable (broadcast may be lost in transmission),
   detrimental to network operations (broadcast storms), prone to
   multiplication attacks (a unicast from the outside may cause a
   broadcast inside), and detrimental to privacy (an observer inside the
   network may listen to broadcasts and learn more than it needs for its
   own operation).

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA                   March 2023


   The IPv6 ND Neighbor Solicitation (NS) [RFC4861] message is used as a
   multicast IP packet for Address Resolution (AR) and Duplicate Address
   Detection (DAD) [RFC4862].  In those cases, the NS message is sent at
   the Network Layer to a Solicited-Node Multicast Address (SNMA)
   [RFC4291] and should in theory only reach a very small group of
   nodes.  It is intended for one Target, that may or may not be present
   in the network, but it is often turned into a MAC-Layer broadcast and
   effectively reaches most of the nodes that are attached to the layer
   2 link.

   DAD was designed for the efficient broadcast operation of Ethernet.
   Experiments show that DAD often fails to discover the duplication of
   IPv6 addresses in large wireless access networks [DAD ISSUES].  In
   practice, IPv6 addresses very rarely conflict, not because the
   address duplications are detected and resolved by the DAD operation,
   but thanks to the entropy of the 64-bit Interface IDs (IIDs) that
   makes a collision quasi-impossible for randomized IIDs.

   Arguably, IPv6 ND brought the support if multicast that should have
   reduced the broadcast traffic for DAD and AR, but in practice IPv6 ND
   multicast messages are mapped to link-layer broadcast on Ethernet and
   Wireless networks, and replication on overlays.  The multicast model
   to Solicited Node Multicast Addresses (SNMA) probably does not make
   much economical sense either, since it would mean close to one state
   per address is every switch (there's usually only one address with
   the same SNMA, though the birthday paradox applies) when a complete
   ND cache would require only one state in every router, and there are
   typically far less routers than switches in the subnet.

   Multicast NS transmissions may occur when a node joins the network,
   moves, or wakes up and reconnects to the network.  Over a very large
   fabric, this can generate hundreds of broadcasts per second.  If the
   broadcasts were blindly copied over Wi-Fi, the MAC-layer broadcast
   traffic associated to ND IP-layer multicast could consume enough
   bandwidth to cause a substantial degradation to the unicast service
   [MCAST EFFICIENCY].  To protect their bandwidth, some networks
   throttle ND-related broadcasts, which reduces the capability for the
   ND protocol to operate as expected.

   The IPv6 ND Neighbor Advertisement (NA) [RFC4861] message can also be
   sent multicast, as a gratuitous information that can be used to
   override the neighbor cache entries (NCEs) in all nodes with the Link
   Layer Address (LLA) of the sender.

   This problem can be alleviated by reducing the size of the broadcast
   domain that encompasses wireless access links.  This has been done in
   the art of IP subnetting by partitioning the subnets and by routing
   between them, at the extreme by assigning a /64 prefix to each
   wireless node (see [RFC8273]).

   Another way to split the broadcast domain within a subnet is to proxy
   at the boundary of the wired and wireless domains the Network Layer
   protocols that rely on link-layer broadcast operations.  [IEEE Std.
   802.11] recommends deploying proxies for the IPv4 Address Resolution
   Protocol (ARP) and IPv6 ND at the APs.  This requires the exhaustive
   list of the IP addresses for which proxying is provided.  Forming and
   maintaining that knowledge is a hard problem in the general case of
   radio connectivity, which keeps changing with movements and
   variations in the environment that alter the range of transmissions.

   [SAVI] suggests discovering the addresses by snooping the ND-Classic
   protocol, but that can also be unreliable.  An IPv6 address may not
   be discovered immediately due to a packet loss.  It may never be
   discovered in the case of a "silent" node that is not currently using
   one of its addresses, e.g., a printer that waits in wake-on-lan
   state.  A change of anchor, e.g. due to a movement, may be missed or
   misordered, leading to unreliable connectivity and an incomplete list
   of addresses.

2.2.  The case of Wireless

   As opposed to unicast transmissions, the broadcast transmissions over
   wireless links are not subject to automatic retries (ARQ) and can be
   very unreliable.  Reducing the speed at the physical (PHY) layer for
   broadcast transmissions can increase the reliability, at the expense
   of a higher relative cost of broadcast on the overall available
   bandwidth.  As a result, protocols designed for bridged networks that
   rely on broadcast transmissions often exhibit disappointing behaviors
   when employed unmodified on a local wireless medium (see [MCAST
   PROBLEMS]).

   Like Transparent Bridging, the IPv6 [RFC8200] Neighbor Discovery
   [RFC4861] [RFC4862] Protocol (ND-Classic) is reactive, and relies on
   reactive Network Layer multicast for AR to locate an on-link
   correspondent and DAD to ensure the uniqueness of an IPv6 address in
   the case of Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC).  On Ethernet
   LANs and most WLANs and Low-Power Personal Area Networks (LoWPANs),
   the Network Layer multicast operation is typically implemented as a
   link-layer broadcast for the lack of an adapted and scalable link-
   layer multicast operation.

   It results that on wireless, an ND-Classic multicast message is
   typically broadcasted.  So even though there are very few nodes
   subscribed to the Network Layer multicast group, and there is at most
   one intended Target, the broadcast is received by many wireless nodes
   over the whole subnet (e.g., the ESS fabric).  And yet, the broadcast
   transmission being unreliable, the intended Target may effectively
   have missed the packet.

   On paper, a Wi-Fi station must keep its radio turned on to listen to
   the periodic series of broadcast frames, which for the most part will
   be dropped when they reach Network Layer.  In order to avoid this
   waste of energy and increase its battery life, a typical battery-
   operated device such as an IoT sensor or a smartphone will blindly
   ignore a ratio of the broadcasts, making ND-Classic operations even
   less reliable.

   Wi-Fi [IEEE Std. 802.11] Access Points (APs) deployed in an Extended
   Service Set (ESS) act as [IEEE Std. 802.1] bridges between the
   wireless stations (STA) and the wired backbone.  As opposed to the
   classical Transparent (aka Learning) Bridge operation that installs
   the forwarding state reactively to traffic, the bridging state in the
   AP is established proactively, at the time of association.  This
   protects the wireless medium against broadcast-intensive Transparent
   Bridging lookups.  The association process registers the link-layer
   (MAC) Address (LLA) of the STA to the AP proactively, i.e., before it
   is needed.  The AP maintains the list of the associated addresses and
   blocks the lookups for destinations that are not registered.  This
   solves the broadcast issue for the link-layer lookups, but the
   Network Layer problem remains.

2.3.  The case of Overlays

   Layer-2 Overlays (VLANs) reduce the broadcast domain from the
   physical one, whereas Layer-3 overlays (e.g., VxLAN) can extend the
   Subnet beyond the limits of the physical network, enabling to deploy
   a Subnet over large physical domains.  Layer-3 overlays are a clear
   indication of the need to decouple the Subnet from the limits of
   physical network.

   A Layer-3 overlay is typically a partial or full mesh of point to
   point tunnel connections between routers.  In case of a full mesh, a
   BUM (Broadcast, Unknown, and Multicast) forwarding over the overly
   can be implemented as ingress replication, which becomes detrimental
   to the operation of the ingress router as the overlay grows in
   number.  This can be optimized in multisite operations so only one
   copy flies across sites in Data Center Interconnect (DCI)
   environments.  Still, BUM processing is costly as it spreads across
   all sites that the overlay spans, and its use should be limited to
   operations where a real broadcast operation is desired, e.g., every
   node is interested in receiving the packet.

   As discussed in Section 2.2, multicast IPv6 ND messages are in fact
   broadcasted over the network, meaning that in the case of an overlay,
   they contribute to the BUM traffic as full broadcast.  While a
   broadcast IPv6 ND RA message may be of interest within a site or a
   subsite to all local nodes, it is probably of little interest to
   other sites that are served by other routers, even when the overlay
   spans across both sites.  The same goes for a local printer, the
   broadcast mDNS lookup should reach local printers but not faraway
   ones.  This is another indication of the need to decouple the span of
   the Subnet from the lower layer broadcast domain.

   Broadcast IPv6 ND NS messages used for lookup and DAD intend to reach
   at most one node.  When those messages is used over the fabric and
   the target is a silent node, which location is unknown to the fabric,
   either the NS message is broadcasted, or the packet is lost, meaning
   that the silent node will not be reachable again until it provides
   its own sign of life.  Using a BUM transmission that reaches every
   nodes to communicate with at most one is a misuse of the overlay
   resources and should be replaced by unicast-based methods.

   In data centers, overlays are typically combined with multihoming at
   the edge.  An advanced Network Interface Card (NIC) is equipped with
   more than one physical adapter (typically Ethernet) for redundancy,
   and the physical adapters connect to different leaf switches (aka
   ToR) to the same cloud network.  The server (say, using Kubernetes)
   needs a single address and would rather use that address on both
   ports to the same Subnet, and use either adapter for its own reasons,
   e.g., load balancing, independently of IP addressing considerations.
   This means that the Interface abstraction that the server needs is a
   logical construct, decoupled from the physical adapters, and capable
   to encompass more than one.

2.4.  Power and Sustainability

   Misusing broadcast entails extraneous power consumption in any
   switched or wireless environment.  In the wireless case, broadcasts
   are sent at the slowest speed available in order to maximize the
   chances that all nodes in the BSS will receive the frame; not only
   does this consume more precious bandwidth than anycast transmission
   and generate interferes which may cascade in losses and retries in
   adjacent networks, this also means that power is consumed for a
   longer time (can be hundred time more) than for unicast.  Power is
   also wasted when replicating a packet to span an overlay.  In all
   cases, to make the internet greener, we must reconsider the use of
   broadcast over large access networks.  To maintain the capability to
   build the Subnets we want, this means that we must decouple the
   Subnet from the broadcast domain, make the broadcast domain small and
   local, and refocus the use of broadcast to the cases where all nodes
   are interested.

   Constrained IoT devices conserve their power by placing themselves in
   deep sleep for most of the time.  While a device is sleeping, it
   cannot answer IPv6 ND messages for AR and DAD.  This makes IPv6 ND
   unsuitable to IoT devices.  The 6LoWPAN WG has determined that the
   most appropriate model for a constrained network is a pull model
   where the device wakes up, negotiates with its router(s) for
   addresses and connectivity for some amount of time in the future, and
   goes back to sleep.  The router can then perform a role of sleep
   proxy that defends the address(es) and holds traffic for the device
   till the device wakes up and pulls it from the router.  Additionally,
   when the constrained network grows into a mesh, broadcast operations
   become rapidly inacceptable in terms of power and bandwidth, and the
   not-only model whereby for the most part hosts do not lookup one
   another, is mandatory.

2.5.  Security and Privacy

   Broadcasting NS and NA messages exposes to the source to the whole
   network, including nodes that do not need to know that the source is
   present on the network.  A passive listener my learn a lot on the
   presence of others and the source has no control over that.  A more
   private approach has each node see and connect to only a subset of
   the routers using the not-onlink model, leaving the source the
   capability to shortcut to the destination based on redirect messages
   from the router, provided that the source wishes to do so.

   Once it has discovered the presence of neighbor addresses, it becomes
   easy for the onlink attacker to impersonate any host in the network,
   either by sourcing packets with a stolen address, or by overriding
   the neighbor caches with a NA that indicates the attacker's LLA.  It

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA                   March 2023


   is thus desirable to avoid exposing the host IPv6 address in
   broadcast ND messages.  Additionally, it is desirable that only the
   address owner can source packets with that address, and that another
   party may not claim and obtain that address.

   The reactive NS lookup method can also be leveraged from the outside
   of the network to perform DOS attacks on constrained resources.  The
   attacker just needs to forge any random address from the subnet
   prefix and send the packet.  The Subnet ingress router will have to
   store that packet for the duration of the lookup time, and broadcast
   an NS to lookup the fake address.  This both locks memory in the
   router and consumes bandwidth in the Subnet.

   To avoid the lookup delays and associated attacks, it makes sense to
   use a proactive method whereby the router knows all the address
   mappings in advance, so that if the destination address is not
   present in the router tables, then the destination does not exist in
   the network and the packet can safely be dropped by the forwarding
   engine.

2.6.  More Middleboxes

   The above problems have been observed for at least since ealy 2000s.
   A number of actions were taken.  For instance, IEEE std 802.11 [IEEE
   Std. 802.11] mandates the support of a middlebox operation called
   "ARP proxy" for IPv4 and IPv6 in the Access Point (AP) that cancels
   broadcasts over a BSS when the IP target of the ARP/ND message is not
   associated to the AP.  With IPv4, the expectation is that the STA
   owns one address, and that the address is obtained via DHCP right
   after the association, so it is pretty easy to snoop the address in
   the DHCP exchange (as long as it remains in the clear) and cancel
   undesirable ARP lookups.

   In contrast to IPv4, IPv6 enables a node to form multiple addresses,
   some of them temporary and with a particular attention paid to
   privacy.  Addresses may be formed and deprecated asynchronously to
   the association.  Even if the knowledge of IPv6 addresses used by a
   STA can be obtained by snooping protocols such as IPv6 ND and DHCPv6,
   or by observing data traffic sourced at the STA, such methods provide
   only an imperfect knowledge of the state of the STA at the AP.  This
   may result in a loss of connectivity for some IPv6 addresses, in
   particular for addresses rarely used and in a situation of mobility.
   This may also result in undesirable state persistence in the AP when
   a STA ceases to use an IPv6 address.  It follows that snooping
   protocols is not a recommended technique and that it should only be
   used as last resort.

   Because IPv6 ND is so easy to attack, some vendors have deployed
   undocumented proprietary counter measures as middlebox operation in
   the switches and routers.  Those middleboxes snoop the ND protocol
   messages, filter them or modify them, for instance to change their
   scope from multicast to unicast.  Based on the snooped information,
   the middlebox may for instance drop an RA message that appears to be
   coming from a host (e.g., as inferred because it arrives on a
   wireless interface), or an NA message that appears to be coming from
   a device that does not appear to be the owner.  But, for the lack of
   an explicit contract between the host and the middlebox, the
   middlebox cannot determine who the earl owner is, and it may reject
   the rightful owner.

   The middlebox may also block SLAAC from a host above a fixed number
   of addresses, to protect the network resources (addresses are an
   expensive and thus limited resource in a managed network) unbeknownst
   to the host.  When that happens, the host believes that it can use
   the address but fails to connect with it.  This might happen even if
   the host has ceased to use other addresses and is now within the
   quota, because ND lacks a method for the host to know how many
   addresses it can own, and for the router to know which addresses the
   host uses at any point of time.  The infrastructure needs a
   deterministic knowledge of the addresses in use, and for that a
   contract must be passed between the host and the network to ensure
   that the addresses are usable.

   Maybe the most insidious side effect of those middleboxes is that as
   opposed to NAT, they are obfuscated and proprietary.  From one vendor
   to the next, and one product generation to the next, their behavior
   may evolve and affect the ND protocol in different fashions.  In the
   short term, this may only impact some specific deployments, which may
   have to work around the issues.  But worse than that, this may affect
   the future and the capability we have to evolve the protocols, like
   firewalls impact our capability to develop new transports in parallel
   to TCP and UDP.  We must either standardize (e.g., for ND proxy) or
   eliminate those middlebox activities, and for that, the IPv6 ND
   protocol must evolve to a model where the middleboxes are not needed
   anymore.  This means that we need a model that minimizes the use of
   broadcasts, and where a contract provides mutual guarantees for the
   host that need IPv6 addresses and the routers that provide
   reachability and protection for these addresses.

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA                   March 2023


2.7.  Summary of Issues

   IPv6 ND inherited 2 majors design points from IPv4, a strong coupling
   of logical and physical concepts, which creates unacceptable
   constraints on modern deployments with virtual and intangible links,
   and a reactive operation for AR and DAD that requires an extensive
   use of broadcast.  While IPv4 and IPv6 behaviors are similar for
   addresses obtained via DHCP, the cost of AR and DAD makes IPv6
   significantly more expensive with Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
   (SLAAC) is used.  And while IPv4 supported NBMA and P2MP models
   (e.g., on Frame Relay leveraging OSPFv2), the IPv6 promise to support
   NBMA (for ATM) remained unmet to this day, and only P2P and Transit
   links are properly supported by IPv6 ND.  For those reasons, IPv6
   with SLAAC can be significantly less attractive than IPv4 to some
   network administrators.

   IPv6 ND exposes all addresses to all nodes in the network, which is
   unfit for privacy.  It is prone to DOS attacks from outside the
   network and impersonation attacks from the inside, with no method to
   prove the address ownership and perform Source Address Validation
   (SAVI) later on the data traffic.  To protect against such threats,
   the vendors had to introduce middleboxes that interfere with the
   protocol operation and affect the capability to evolve the protocol
   in the future.

   IPv6 ND lack a support for mobility (which typically entails a
   sequence counter maintained by the host and the deprecation of state
   that is based on older sequences) and for anycast.  This makes it
   very hard for the network to defend the addresses on behalf of the
   owner, e.g., when the owner is temporarily disconnected.  It results
   that the operation of the middleboxes is unsatisfactory and may cause
   discontinuities in connectivity.

   The broadcast operation is not only detrimental to bandwidth, it is
   also an issue for energy conservation and sustainability.  Devices
   must be always attached and always powered on to answer lookups and
   DADs, which makes IPv6 ND unapplicable to constrained IoT devices
   that sleep for the vast majority of their time.  The key design
   points in this architecture derive from the original observations
   made at the 6LoWPAN WG, and focus on avoiding waste of constrained
   resources such as spectrum and energy, by using broadcasts only when
   broadcast is really needed, and decoupling the IP abstraction of a
   Subnet from the broadcast domains.

3.  An Architecture for IPv6 over Non-Broadcast Networks

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA                   March 2023


3.1.  Basic Concepts

   This document introduces a new architecture to IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery that is designed to apply to the WLANs and LoWPANs types of
   networks, as well as other Non-Broadcast Multi-Access (NBMA) networks
   such as Data-Center overlays.  The architecture leverages the not-
   onlink model and routing inside the subnet, which enables to form
   potentially large MLSNs without creating a large broadcast domain at
   the link-layer.

   To support the deployment agility that virtual (e.g., VxLAN overlays
   and pseudowires) and intangible (e.g., wireless, laser, and quantum)
   links enable, the IP abstractions of Interface, Link, and Subnet are
   decoupled from their classical physical counterparts of interface,
   link, and broadcast domains.  The Subnet is defined by a /64 prefix,
   as the longest aggregation that can be advertised in the IGP with the
   outside.  Host routes and longer prefixes are advertised inside the
   Subnet only, using a separate Subnet Gateway protocol.

   Any device that owns an address within the Subnet prefix belongs to
   the subnet, this is now decoupled from the physical connectivity and
   broadcast domain.  Instead, the IPv6 routers that serve a Subnet must
   form a connected dominating set such that every host in the Subnet is
   connected to at least one router and the routers are connected to one
   another directly (classical NBMA, aka full mesh) or indirectly via
   other routers (Point to MultiPoint, P2MP, aka partial mesh).  The
   not-onlink model is used throughout, so hosts do not look each other
   up, saving all the associated broadcast.  Instead, they rely on the
   routers to forward the packets inside and outside the Subnet.  This
   way, the Subnet can have any structure needed for the deployment,
   where hosts can move from router to router in the Subnet, or anywhere
   in the Internet provided they can lay a mobility tunnel to one of the
   routers for use as IP Link to the Subnet.

   All IP links are abstracted as Point-to-Point, though a lower-layer
   broadcast service may be used by the router to send RAs to a subset
   of local hosts in the subnet, or by the host to send an RS message to
   a subset of the routers.  An IP Interface bundles one or more
   subInterfaces, one per Subnet that can be reached through that
   Interface.  A Global IPv6 address is installed on the subInterface
   that connects to the Subnet from which the address derives.  The IP
   Interface connects to one or more IP Links (to different neighbors)
   over the same or over different physical interfaces (they are
   decoupled).  A Link-Local Address is associated to the IP Link
   directly.  Each SubInterface connects to the subset of those IP Links
   that reach other nodes in the Subnet.

   In a fashion similar to a Wi-Fi Association, IPv6 Hosts register
   their addresses to their serving router(s), which may reject the
   registration, e.g., in case of a duplication.  To support distributed
   routers in the Subnet, an abstract registrar service maintains the
   state of all active registrations in the Subnet and answers queries
   to lookup mappings, validate ownership, and avoid duplications.  The
   registration is abstract to the routing service and the registrar
   service, and it can be protected to prevent impersonation attacks.
   The registration enables the network to know deterministically all
   the IPv6 addresses and LLA mapping currently in use, and eliminates
   the need for lookups and DAD, and for the associated broadcasts.

   With the registration, the routers have a complete knowledge of the
   hosts they serve and in return, hosts obtain routing services for
   their registered addresses.  The abstract routing service allows an
   ingress router to find a path to the destination address within the
   subnet.  It can be a simple reflection in a Hub-and-Spoke subnet that
   emulates an IEEE Std. 802.11 Infrastructure BSS at the Network Layer.
   It can also be a full-fledge routing protocol, e.g., RPL, which is
   designed to adapt to various LLNs such as WLAN and WPAN radio meshes,
   see [RFC9010] for more, or BGP/EVPN, for application in data centers,
   see [RFC8365] for more.  It can be based on overlay tunnels between
   ingress router and egress router leveraging a resolver service such
   as LISP, see [RFC7834] for more.  Finally, the routing service can
   also be an ND proxy that emulates an IEEE Std. 802.11 Infrastructure
   ESS at the Network Layer, as specified in the IPv6 Backbone Router
   [RFC8929].

   The abstract registrar service maintains the mapping between the
   registered node link-layer address and the registered IPv6 address.
   It contains meta data that enables to ascertain that the second
   registration for the same address is performed for the same
   registered node, so it also binds the registered node with the
   registered IPv6 address.  The registrar service provides APIs to look
   up a link-layer address for an IPv6 address as well as validate IPv6
   address ownership.  The registrar can be implemented as a mapping
   server ala LISP, a distributed state ala ND proxy, or a synchronized
   state ala EVPN.  In the former case, this enables the reactive
   lookups to be performed as unicast requests to the map resolver.  In
   the latter, the address mapping is synchronized by the routing
   protocol and known to all the routers for all nodes in the IP Subnet,
   so there is never a need for a reactive lookup.

   On the one hand, the Architecture proposed in this document avoids
   the use of broadcast operation for DAD and AR, and on the other hand,
   it supports use cases where subnet and link-layer domains are not
   congruent, which is common in wireless networks unless a specific
   link-layer emulation is provided.

   The address registration provides a contractual interface between the
   nodes and the routers where nodes can ask for addresses which will be
   guaranteed to be operational for a contractual lifetime, and the
   network may accept or refuse granting additional addresses based on
   state (e.g., duplicate address) as well as policy (e.g., quota).
   This ways hosts and routers agree deterministically on which
   addresses will be served to which nodes in the Subnet.  That
   interface is agnostic to the router to router and router to
   registrar.  The latter interfaces can be implemented in various
   fashions that can blend in existing technologies such as legacy IPv6
   ND network through ND proxy, EVPN- and LISP-based overlays.

3.2.  Terminology

3.2.1.  IP Links

   For a long time, the term link has been used to refer to the layer 2
   communication medium that can be leveraged at layer 3 to instantiate
   one IP hop.  In this document we conserve that term but differentiate
   it from an IP link, which is a layer 3 abstraction that represents
   the layer 2 link but is not the layer 2 link, like the map is not the
   country.

   With IPv6, IP has moved to layer 3 abstractions for its operations,
   e.g., with the use of link local address (LLA), and that of IP
   multicast for link-scoped operations.  At the same time, the concept
   of an IP link emerged as an abstraction that represents how IP layer
   considers the layer 2 link:

   *  An IP link connects an IP node to one or more other IP nodes using
      a lower layer subnetwork.  The lower layer subnetwork may comprise
      multiple lower layer links, e.g., in the case of a switched fabric
      or a mesh-under LLN.

   *  an IP link defines the scope of an LLA, and defines the domain in
      which the LLA must be unique

   *  an IP link provides a subset of the connectivity that is offered
      by the lower layer; if the IP link is narrower than the layer 2
      reachable domain, then layer 3 filters must restrict the link-
      scoped communication to remain between peers on a same IP link,
      and more than one IP link may be installed on the same physical
      interface to connect to different peers.

   *  an IP link can be Point to Point (P2P), Point to Point (P2MP,
      forming a partial mesh), NBMA (non-broadcast multi-access, fully
      meshed), or transit (broadcast-capable and any-to-any).  With this
      architecture, all links are abstracted as P2P.



Thubert & Richardson    Expires 3 September 2023               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA                   March 2023


   It is a network design decision to use one IP link model or another
   over a given lower layer network, e.g., to map a Frame Relay network
   as a P2MP IP link, or as a collection of P2P IP links.  As another
   example, an Ethernet fabric may be bridged, in which case the nodes
   that interconnect the layer 2 links are L2 switches, and the fabric
   can be abstracted as a single transit IP link; or the fabric can be
   routed, in which case the P2P IP links are congruent with the layer 2
   links, and the nodes that interconnect the links are routers.

3.2.2.  IP Interfaces

   As is the case for links, the term interface has been historically
   confused between the physical object that provides physical
   connectivity and the IP layer logical object that connects the host
   with the IP Link:

   *  an IP Interface is an abstraction that connects the host with a
      collection of IP Links (for the purpose of link local
      communication) and bundles the interfaces for each IP Subnet in
      subInterfaces.  The host installs at least one link-local address
      on an IP Interface for each IP Link that is connected through that
      interface, and one subInterface per Subnet.  The same Link-Local
      address may be reused over different IP Links as long as it is not
      a collision for the peer on that IP Link.  Similarly, the host
      installs at least one global (or unique local as appropriate)
      address on an IP subInterface for the associated Subnet, and the
      address is advertised over each IP Link in the Subnet.

   *  an IP Interface can be P2P, in which case it connects to a single
      IP Link, or P2MP, in which case it aggregates multiple IP Links.
      In a multihomed host, a single IP Interface can be installed to
      connect to the IP Links associated to different physical
      interfaces, in which case the same IPv6 address may be advertised
      on more than one physical interface.  Conversely, when more than
      one Subnet is reachable over a physical interface, more than one
      IP Interface may leverage that physical interface for
      transmission.

3.2.3.  IP Subnets

   IPv6 builds another abstraction, the IP subnet, over one shared IP
   link or over a collection IP links, forming a MLSN in the latter
   case.  An MLSN is formed over IP links (e.g., P2P or P2MP) that are
   interconnected by routers that either inject hosts routes in an IGP,
   in which case the topology can be anything, or perform ND proxy
   operations, in which case the structure of links must be strictly
   hierarchical to avoid loops.

   [RFC8929] defines bridging and routing IPv6 ND proxies.  Both forms
   of ND proxies interconnect IP links and enable to isolate the layer 2
   broadcast domains.  But in the case of a bridging proxy, the layer 2
   unicast communication can still exist between the layer 2 domains
   that are covered by the layer 3 links, whereas in the base of a
   routing proxy, they are isolated, and packets must be routed back and
   forth.  Bridging proxies are possible between compatible technologies
   and translational bridges (e.g., Wi-Fi to Ethernet), whereas routing
   proxies are required between non-bridgeable technologies and
   desirable to avoid exposing the layer 2 addresses across, e.g., for
   reasons of stability and scalability.

   It is another network design decision to use one IP subnet model or
   another over a given lower layer network.  A switched fabric can host
   one or more IP subnets, in which case the IP links can reach all and
   beyond one subnet.  On the other hand, a subnet can encompass a
   collection of links; in that case, the scope of the link local
   addresses, which is the IP Link, is narrower than the span of the
   subnet.

   A subnet prefix is associated with the IP subnet, and a node is a
   member of an IP subnet when it has an IP address that derives from
   that prefix.  The IP address is either a Unique Local (ULA) or a
   Global Unicast Address (GUA), and as opposed to the case of LLAs, the
   scope of the address is not limited to the IP subnet.

   The switched and routed fabric above could be the exact same network
   of physical links and boxes, what changes is the way the networking
   abstractions are mapped onto the system, and the implication of such
   decision include the capability to reach another node at layer-2, and
   the size of the broadcast domain and related broadcast storms.

3.2.4.  Subnet Gateway Protocols

   The /64 boundary creates a wall between the traditional Interior
   Gateway Protocols (IGP) that operate between Subnets and manipulate
   shorter than 64 prefixes, and Subnet Gateway Protocols (SGP) that
   operate inside a Subnet and manipulate shorter than 64 prefixes,
   typically /128 host routes, and possibly more specific data like
   Link-Layer Address mappings and Address Proof of Ownership.

   As opposed to classical IGPs, an SGP must support rapid mobility of
   addresses to cope with wireless devices and virtual machines
   mobility.  In that regard, an SGP operates mores as a MANET protocol
   than as a classical IGP.  Ideally, there should be no stale route,
   and no microloop.  A classical method in MANETs to achieve this is to
   sequence the movements and advertise the sequence in the routing
   protocol, so only routes with the most recent sequence can be

   followed, and once a packet starts following a route with a certain
   sequence, it must be discarded rather to have to follow a path with
   an older sequence.  To support this approach, the node that registers
   an address must be the owner of a mobility sequence number and update
   that sequence when it moves.

   Multihoming being a classical requirement in DC environments, the SGP
   must be able to differentiate not only address duplication from
   movement, but also from anycast addresses, which can be advertised
   from multiple places in a coordinated (same mobility sequence) or
   uncoordinated fashion.  For unicast addresses, an token that
   identifies the address owner can be used for address duplication
   avoidance, and if that token is cryptographic, it can be used as
   registration ownership verifier as well.

3.3.1.  Physical Broadcast Domain

   At the physical (PHY) Layer, a broadcast domain is the set of nodes
   that may receive a transmission that one sends over an interface, in
   other words the set of nodes in range of the radio transmission.
   This set can comprise a single peer on a serial cable used as point-
   to-point link.  It may also comprise multiple peer nodes on a
   broadcast radio or a shared physical resource such as the Ethernet
   wires and hubs for which ND-Classic was initially designed.

   On WLAN and LoWPAN radios, the physical broadcast domain is defined
   relative to a particular transmitter, as the set of nodes that can
   receive what this transmitter is sending.  Literally every frame
   defines its own broadcast domain since the chances of reception of a
   given frame are statistical.  In average and in stable conditions,
   the broadcast domain of a particular node can be still be seen as
   mostly constant and can be used to define a closure of nodes on which
   an upper Layer abstraction can be built.

   A PHY Layer communication can be established between two nodes if the
   physical broadcast domains of their unicast transmissions overlap.
   On WLAN and LoWPAN radios, that relation is usually not reflexive,
   since nodes disable the reception when they transmit; still they may
   retain a copy of the transmitted frame, so it can be seen as
   reflexive at the MAC Layer.  It is often symmetric, meaning that if B
   can receive a frame from A, then A can receive a frame from B.  But
   there can be asymmetries due to power levels, interferers near one of
   the receivers, or differences in the quality of the hardware (e.g.,
   crystals, PAs and antennas) that may affect the balance to the point
   that the connectivity becomes mostly uni-directional, e.g., A to B
   but practically not B to A.

   It takes a particular effort to place a set of devices in a fashion
   that all their physical broadcast domains fully overlap, and that
   specific situation can not be assumed in the general case.  In other
   words, the relation of radio connectivity is generally not
   transitive, meaning that A in range with B and B in range with C does
   not necessarily imply that A is in range with C.

3.3.2.  link-layer Broadcast Emulations

   We call Direct MAC Broadcast (DMB) the transmission mode where the
   broadcast domain that is usable at the MAC layer is directly the
   physical broadcast domain.  IEEE Std. 802.15.4 [IEEE Std. 802.15.4]
   and IEEE Std. 802.11 [IEEE Std. 802.11] OCB (for Out of the Context
   of a BSS) are examples of DMB radios.  DMB networks provide mostly
   symmetric and non-transitive transmission.  This contrasts with a
   number of link-layer Broadcast Emulation (LLBE) schemes that are
   described in this section.

   In the case of Ethernet, while a physical broadcast domain is
   constrained to a single shared wire, the IEEE Std. 802.1 [IEEE Std.
   802.1] bridging function emulates the broadcast properties of that
   wire over a whole physical mesh of Ethernet links.  For the upper
   layer, the qualities of the shared wire are essentially conserved,
   with a reliable and cheap broadcast operation over a transitive
   closure of nodes defined by their connectivity to the emulated wire.

   In large switched fabrics, overlay techniques enable a limited
   connectivity between nodes that are known to a Map Resolver.  The
   emulated broadcast domain is configured to the system, e.g., with a
   VXLAN network identifier (VNID).  Broadcast operations on the overlay
   can be emulated but can become very expensive, and it makes sense to
   proactively install the relevant state in the mapping server as
   opposed to rely on reactive broadcast lookups to do so.

   An IEEE Std. 802.11 [IEEE Std. 802.11] Infrastructure Basic Service
   Set (BSS) also provides a transitive closure of nodes as defined by
   the broadcast domain of a central AP.  The AP relays both unicast and
   broadcast packets and provides the symmetric and transitive emulation
   of a shared wire between the associated nodes, with the capability to
   signal link-up/link-down to the upper layer.  Within a BSS, the
   physical broadcast domain of the AP serves as emulated broadcast
   domain for all the nodes that are associated to the AP.  Broadcast
   packets are relayed by the AP and are not acknowledged.  To increase
   the chances that all nodes in the BSS receive the broadcast
   transmission, AP transmits at the slowest PHY speed.  This translates
   into maximum co-channel interferences for others and the longest
   occupancy of the medium, for a duration that can be a hundred times
   that of the unicast transmission of a frame of the same size.

   For that reason, upper layer protocols should tend to avoid the use
   of broadcast when operating over Wi-Fi.  To cope with this problems,
   APs may implement strategies such as turn a broadcast into a series
   of unicast transmissions, or drop the message altogether, which may
   impact the upper layer protocols.  For instance, some APs may not
   copy Router Solicitation (RS) messages under the assumption that



Thubert & Richardson    Expires 3 September 2023               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA                   March 2023


   there is no router across the wireless interface.  This assumption
   may be correct at some point of time and may become incorrect in the
   future.  Another strategy used in Wi-Fi APS is to proxy protocols
   that heavily rely on broadcast, such as the Address Resolution in ARP
   and ND-Classic, and either respond on behalf or preferably forward
   the broadcast frame as a unicast to the intended Target.

   In an IEEE Std. 802.11 [IEEE Std. 802.11] Infrastructure Extended
   Service Set (ESS), infrastructure BSSes are interconnected by a
   bridged network, typically running Transparent Bridging and the
   Spanning tree Protocol or a more advanced Layer 2 Routing (L2R)
   scheme.  In the original model of learning bridges, the forwarding
   state is set by observing the source MAC address of the frames.  When
   a state is missing for a destination MAC address, the frame is
   broadcasted with the expectation that the response will populate the
   state on the reverse path.  This is a reactive operation, meaning
   that the state is populated reactively to the need to reach a
   destination.  It is also possible in the original model to broadcast
   a gratuitous frame to advertise self throughout the bridged network,
   and that is also a broadcast.

   The process of the Wi-Fi association prepares a bridging state
   proactively at the AP, which avoids the need for a reactive broadcast
   lookup over the wireless access.  In an ESS, the AP may also generate
   a gratuitous broadcast sourced at the MAC address of the STA to
   prepare or update the state in the learning bridges so they point
   towards the AP for the MAC address of the STA.  WiND emulates that
   proactive method at the Network Layer for the operations of AR, DAD
   and ND proxy.

   In some instances of WLANs and LoWPANs, a Mesh-Under technology
   (e.g., a IEEE Std. 802.11s or IEEE Std. 802.15.10) provides meshing
   services that are similar to bridging, and the broadcast domain is
   well-defined by the membership of the mesh.  Mesh-Under emulates a
   broadcast domain by flooding the broadcast packets at the link-layer.
   When operating on a single frequency, this operation is known to
   interfere with itself, and requires inter-frame gaps to dampen the
   collisions, which reduces further the amount of available bandwidth.

   As the cost of broadcast transmissions becomes increasingly
   expensive, there is a push to rethink the upper Layer protocols to
   reduce the dependency on broadcast operations.

3.3.3.  Mapping the IPv6 link Abstraction

   As introduced in Section 3.2.1, IPv6 defines a concept of link, link
   scope and Link-Local Addresses (LLA), an LLA being unique and usable
   only within the Scope of a Link.  The ND-Classic [RFC4861] DAD
   [RFC4862] process uses a multicast transmission to detect a duplicate
   address, which requires that the owner of the address is connected to
   the link-layer broadcast domain of the sender.

   On a wired medium, the IP link is often confused with the physical
   broadcast domain because both are determined by the serial cable or
   the Ethernet shared wire.  Ethernet Bridging reinforces that illusion
   with a link-layer broadcast domain that emulates a physical broadcast
   domain over the mesh of wires.  But the difference shows on legacy
   P2MP and NBMA networks such as ATM and Frame-Relay, on shared links
   and on newer types of NBMA networks such as radio and composite
   radio-wires networks.  It also shows when private VLANs or link-layer
   cryptography restrict the capability to read a frame to a subset of
   the connected nodes.

   In Mesh-Under and Infrastructure BSS, the IP link extends beyond the
   physical broadcast domain to the emulated link-layer broadcast
   domain.  Relying on Multicast for the ND operation remains feasible
   but becomes highly detrimental to the unicast traffic, and becomes
   less and less energy-efficient and reliable as the network grows.

   On DMB radios, IP links between peers come and go as the individual
   physical broadcast domains of the transmitters meet and overlap.  The
   DAD operation cannot provide once and for all guarantees over the
   broadcast domain defined by one radio transmitter if that transmitter
   keeps meeting new peers on the go.

   The scope on which the uniqueness of an LLA must be checked is each
   new pair of nodes for the duration of their conversation.  As long as
   there's no conflict, a node may use the same LLA with multiple peers
   but it has to perform DAD again with each new peer.  A node may need
   to form a new LLA to talk to a new peer, and multiple LLAs may be
   present in the same radio interface to talk to different peers.  In
   practice, each pair of nodes defines a temporary P2P link, which can
   be modeled as a sub-interface of the radio interface.

   The DAD and AR procedures in ND-Classic expect that a node in a
   subnet is reachable within the broadcast domain of any other node in
   the subnet when that other node attempts to form an address that
   would be a duplicate or attempts to resolve the MAC address of this
   node.  This is why ND is applicable for P2P and transit links, but
   requires extensions for more complex topologies.

3.3.4.  Mapping the IPv6 subnet Abstraction

   As introduced in Section 3.2.3, IPv6 also defines the concept of a
   subnet for Global and Unique Local Addresses (GLA and ULA).  All the
   addresses in a subnet share the same prefix, and by extension, a node
   belongs to a subnet if it has an address that derives from the prefix
   of the subnet.  That address must be topologically correct, meaning
   that it must be installed on an interface that is connected to the
   subnet.

   Unless intently replicated in different locations for very specific
   purposes, a subnet prefix is unique within a routing system; for
   ULAs, the routing system is typically a limited domain, whereas for
   GLAs, it is the whole Internet.

   For that reason, it is sufficient to validate that an address that is
   formed from a subnet prefix is unique within the scope of that subnet
   to guarantee that it is globally unique within the whole routing
   system.  Note that a subnet may become partitioned due to the loss of
   a wired or wireless link, so even that operation is not necessarily
   obvious, more in [DAD APPROACHES].

   The IPv6 aggregation model relies on the property that a packet from
   the outside of a subnet can be routed to any router that belongs to
   the subnet, and that this router will be able to either resolve the
   destination link-layer address and deliver the packet, or, in the
   case of an MLSN, route the packet to the destination within the
   subnet.

   If the subnet is known as on-link, then any node may also resolve the
   destination link-layer address and deliver the packet, but if the
   subnet is not on-link, then a host in the subnet that does not have a
   Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE) for the destination will also need to pass
   the packet to a router, more in [RFC5942].

   On Ethernet, an IP subnet is often congruent with an IP link because
   both are determined by the physical attachment to a shared wire or an
   IEEE Std. 802.1 bridged domain.  In that case, the connectivity over
   the IP link is both symmetric and transitive, the subnet can appear
   as on-link, and any node can resolve a destination MAC address of any
   other node directly using ND-Classic.

   But an IP link and an IP subnet are not always congruent.  In the
   case of a Shared Link, individual subnets may each encompass only a
   subset of the nodes connected to the link.  Conversely, in Route-Over
   Multi-link subnets (MLSN) [RFC4903], routers federate the links
   between nodes that belong to the subnet, the subnet is not on-link
   and it extends beyond any of the federated links.

3.4.  Stateful Address Autoconfiguration and Subnet Routing

   This Architecture defines a new operation for ND that is based on 2
   major paradigm changes, a proactive address registration by hosts to
   their attachment routers and routing to host routes (/128) within the
   subnet.  This allows ND to avoid the expectations of transit links
   and subnet-wide broadcast domains.

   The proactive address registration, called Stateful Address
   Autoconfiguration (SFAAC) by opposition to SLAAC, is agnostic to the
   method used for Address Assignment, e.g., Manual, Semantically Opaque
   Autoconfiguration [RFC7217], randomized [RFC8981], or DHCPv6
   [RFC8415].  It does not change the IPv6 addressing [RFC4291] or the
   current practices of assigning prefixes, typically a /64, to a
   subnet.  But the DAD operation is performed as a unicast exchange
   with the abstract egistrar service.

   This Architecture combines SFAAC with the not-onlink model on the IP
   Interfaces.  Hosts do not expect the IP Subnet to be reachable over
   the L2 broadcast domain and rely on their routers to forward the
   packets inside and outside the Subnet.  In turn, the router expose to
   each other all the IPv6 addresses that are either owned or registered
   to it as host routes over a Subnet Gateway Protocol, an IGP that is
   specialized in routing inside the subnet and can be decoupled with
   the routing protocol used between subnets.

4.  A Framework for Stateful Address Autoconfiguration and Subnet
    Routing

4.1.  Implementing Stateful Address Autoconfiguration

   SFAAC was initially standardized for IoT and wireless links as
   [RFC6775], [RFC8505], and [RFC8928].  A new option in NS/NA messages,
   the Extended Address Registration Option (EARO) signals that the
   Target Address is being registered and provides the registration
   parameters [RFC8505].  This method allows to prepare and maintain the
   host routes in the routers and avoids the reactive Address Resolution
   in ND-Classic and the associated link-layer broadcasts transmissions.

   The EARO provides information to the router that is independent to
   the routing protocol and routing can take multiple forms, from a
   traditional IGP to a collapsed Hub-and-Spoke model where only one
   router owns and advertises the prefix.  [RFC8505] is already
   referenced as the registration interface to "RIFT: Routing in Fat
   Trees" [I-D.ietf-rift-rift] and "RPL: IPv6 Routing Protocol for
   Low-Power and Lossy Networks" [RFC6550] with [RFC9010].

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA                   March 2023


   Wireless ND (WiND) is an example instanciation of the Architecture
   presented in Section 3; it combines SFAAC with a Backbone Router
   (6BBR) ND proxy function (more in [RFC8929]) operating as a Layer-3
   Access Point.  Multiple 6BBRs placed along the wireless edge of a
   Backbone link handle IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and forward packets over
   the backbone on behalf of the registered nodes on the wireless edge.
   This enables to span a subnet over an MLSN that federates edge
   wireless links with a high-speed, typically Ethernet, backbone (as a
   Layer-3 ESS).  The ND proxy maintains the reachability for Global
   Unicast and Link-Local Addresses within the federated MLSN, either as
   a routing proxy where it replies with its own MAC address or as a
   bridging proxy that typically forwards the multicast ND messages as
   unicast Layer-2 frames to their target.  The wireless nodes can form
   any address they want and move freely from a wireless edge link to
   another, without renumbering.  In that case, the registrar is
   distributed between the 6BBR, each 6BBR maintaining only a state for
   the subset of the addresses that were registered to it and for which
   it is authoritative.  When the 6BBR is not currently authoritative
   for a new address being registererd to it, it relies on Classical ND
   that is used reactively over the backbone to obtain an existing
   registration state in

   This framework allows other implementations of the abstract concept
   of the registrar.  For instance, [EVPN-SFAAC] allows to distribute
   the registrar in every router, and leverages EVPN as the method to
   synchronize the registrar state between routers.  In that case, BGP
   acts both as the SGP to announce the reachability of the addresses
   and as the synchronization protocol between the distributed
   registrar.  All the routers know proactively the mapping for all the
   addresses, and there is no need for a reactive lookup as is the case
   for WiND.  As another example, a Locator/ID Separation Protocol
   (LISP) Map-Resolver [RFC6830] could support the EDAR/EDAC exchange
   either directly or via a proxy, and serve as registrar.

   The framework allows for mixed environments with registrations and
   classical ND, using [RFC8929] to perform ND proxy operations on
   behalf of registered address and respond to DAD and lookups from
   legacy nodes, and prevent registering nodes from autoconfiguring
   addresses that exist in legacy nodes by performing DAD on behalf of
   the registering nodes.  In cases such as overlays with Map Resolvers,
   this model enables the proxy to intercept broadcast NS lookups and
   perform unicast lookups [UNICAST AR] for addresses registered to the
   resolver and only broadcast when the unicast lookup fails.

4.2.  links and Link-Local Addresses

   For Link-Local Addresses, DAD is typically performed between
   communicating pairs of nodes and an NCE can be populated with a
   single unicast exchange.  In the case of a bridging proxies, though,
   the Link-Local traffic is bridged over the backbone and the DAD must
   proxied there as well.

   For instance, in the case of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
   [RFC7668][IEEEstd802151], the uniqueness of Link-Local Addresses
   needs only to be verified between the pair of communicating nodes,
   the central router and the peripheral host.  In that example, 2
   peripheral hosts connected to the same central router can not have
   the same Link-Local Address because the addresses would collision at
   the central router which could not talk to both over the same
   interface.  The DAD operation from SFAAC is appropriate for that use
   case, but the one from ND is not, because the peripheral hosts are
   not on the same broadcast domain.

   On the other hand, the uniqueness of Global and Unique-Local
   Addresses is validated at the subnet Level, using a logical registrar
   that is global to the subnet.

4.3.  Subnets and Global Addresses

   SFAAC extends ND-Classic for Hub-and-Spoke (e.g., BLE) and Route-Over
   (e.g., RPL) Multi-link subnets (MLSNs).

   In the Hub-and-Spoke case, each Hub-Spoke pair is a distinct IP Link,
   and a subnet can be mapped on a collection of links that are
   connected to the Hub. The subnet prefix is associated to the Hub.

   Acting as a router, the Hub advertises the prefix as not-on-link to
   the spokes in RA messages Prefix Information Options (PIO).  Acting
   as hosts, the Spokes autoconfigure addresses from that prefix and
   register them to the Hub with a corresponding lifetime.

   Acting as a registrar, the Hub maintains a binding table of all the
   registered IP addresses and rejects duplicate registrations, thus
   ensuring a DAD protection for a registered address even if the
   registering node is sleeping.

   The Hub also maintains an NCE for the registered addresses and can
   deliver a packet to any of them during their respective lifetimes.
   It can be observed that this design builds a form of Network Layer
   Infrastructure BSS.

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA                   March 2023


   A Route-Over MLSN is considered as a collection of Hub-and-Spoke
   where the Hubs form a connected dominating set of the member nodes of
   the subnet, and IPv6 routing takes place between the Hubs within the
   subnet.  A single logical registrar is deployed to serve the whole
   mesh.

   The registration in [RFC8505] is abstract to the routing protocol and
   provides enough information to feed a routing protocol such as RPL as
   specified in [RFC9010].  In a degraded mode, all the Hubs are
   connected to a same high speed backbone such as an Ethernet bridging
   domain where ND-Classic is operated.  In that case, it is possible to
   federate the Hub, Spoke and Backbone nodes as a single subnet,
   operating ND proxy operations [RFC8929] at the Hubs, acting as 6BBRs.
   It can be observed that this latter design builds a form of Network
   Layer Infrastructure ESS.

4.4.  Anycast and Multicast Addresses

   While IPv6 ND is defined for unicast addresses only,
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-multicast-registration] extends [RFC8505] for anycast
   and multicast IPv6 addresses.

   [I-D.ietf-6lo-multicast-registration] can be used as a replacement
   for MLDv2 [RFC3810] for use cases where broadcast are not desirable,
   and when a device push model such as SFAAC is preferred over a
   network pull such as MDv2 and classical ND.  With [RFC8505], the host
   does not need to define SNMAs for its unicast addresses and does not
   perform the associated MLDv2 operation.  With
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-multicast-registration], MLDv2 and its extensive use of
   broadcast can be totally eliminated.

   In the case of anycast, the signal enables the 6BBRs to accept more
   than one registration for the same address, and collectively elect
   the registering host receives a packet for a given anycast address.

5.  WiND Applicability

   WiND applies equally to P2P links, P2MP Hub-and-Spoke, link-layer
   Broadcast Domain Emulation such as Mesh-Under and Wi-Fi BSS, and
   Route-Over meshes.

   There is an intersection where The IP link and the IP subnet are
   congruent and where both ND and WiND could apply.  These includes
   P2P, the MAC emulation of a PHY broadcast domain, and the particular
   case of always on, fully overlapping physical radio broadcast domain.
   But even in those cases where both are possible, WiND is preferable
   vs. ND because it reduces the need of broadcast.

   This is discussed in more details in the introduction of [RFC8929].

   There are also a number of practical use cases in the wireless world
   where links and subnets are not congruent:

   *  The IEEE Std. 802.11 infrastructure BSS enables one subnet per AP,
      and emulates a broadcast domain at the link-layer.  The
      Infrastructure ESS extends that model over a backbone and
      recommends the use of an ND proxy [IEEE Std. 802.11] to
      interoperate with Ethernet-connected nodes.  WiND incorporates an
      ND proxy to serve that need, which was missing so far.

   *  BlueTooth is Hub-and-Spoke at the link-layer.  It would make
      little sense to configure a different subnet between the central
      and each individual peripheral node (e.g., sensor).  Rather,
      [RFC7668] allocates a prefix to the central node acting as router,
      and each peripheral host (acting as a host) forms one or more
      address(es) from that same prefix and registers it.

   *  A typical Smartgrid networks puts together Route-Over MLSNs that
      comprise thousands of IPv6 nodes.  The 6TiSCH architecture
      [RFC9030] presents the Route-Over model over an IEEE Std. 802.15.4
      Time-Slotted Channel-Hopping (TSCH) [IEEEstd802154] mesh, and
      generalizes it for multiple other applications.

      Each node in a Smartgrid network may have tens to a hundred others
      nodes in range.  A key problem for the routing protocol is which
      other node(s) should this node peer with, because most of the
      possible peers do not provide added routing value.  When both
      energy and bandwidth are constrained, talking to them is a waste
      of resources and most of the possible P2P links are not even used.
      Peerings that are actually used come and go with the dynamics of
      radio signal propagation.  It results that allocating prefixes to
      all the possible P2P links and maintain as many addresses in all
      nodes is not even considered.

5.1.  Case of LPWANs

   LPWANs are by nature so constrained that the addresses and subnets
   are fully pre-configured and operate as P2P or Hub-and-Spoke.  This
   saves the steps of neighbor Discovery and enables a very efficient
   stateful compression of the IPv6 header.

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA                   March 2023


5.2.  Case of Infrastructure BSS and ESS

   In contrast to IPv4, IPv6 enables a node to form multiple addresses,
   some of them temporary to elusive, and with a particular attention
   paid to privacy.  Addresses may be formed and deprecated
   asynchronously to the association.

   Snooping protocols such as ND-Classic and DHCPv6 and observing data
   traffic sourced at the STA provides an imperfect knowledge of the
   state of the STA at the AP.  Missing a state or a transition may
   result in the loss of connectivity for some of the addresses, in
   particular for an address that is rarely used, belongs to a sleeping
   node, or one in a situation of mobility.  This may also result in
   undesirable remanent state in the AP when the STA ceases to use an
   IPv6 address while remaining associated.  It results that snooping
   protocols is not a recommended technique and that it should only be
   used as last resort, when the WiND registration is not available to
   populate the state.

   The recommended alternative method is to use the WiND Registration
   for IPv6 Addresses.  This way, the AP exposes its capability to proxy
   ND to the STA in Router Advertisement messages.  In turn, the STA may
   request proxy ND services from the AP for all of its IPv6 addresses,
   using the Extended Address Registration Option, which provides the
   following elements:

   *  The registration state has a lifetime that limits unwanted state
      remanence in the network.

   *  The registration is optionally secured using [RFC8928] to prevent
      address theft and impersonation.

   *  The registration carries a sequence number, which enables to
      figure the order of events in a fast mobility scenario without
      loss of connectivity.

   The ESS mode requires a proxy ND operation at the AP.  The proxy ND
   operation must cover Duplicate Address Detection, Neighbor
   Unreachability Detection, Address Resolution and Address Mobility to
   transfer a role of ND proxy to the AP where a STA is associated
   following the mobility of the STA.

   The WiND proxy ND specification that associated to the Address
   Registration is [RFC8929].  With that specification, the AP
   participates to the protocol as a Backbone Router, typically
   operating as a bridging proxy though the routing proxy operation is
   also possible.  As a bridging proxy, the backbone router either
   replies to NS lookups with the MAC address of the STA, or preferably



Thubert & Richardson    Expires 3 September 2023               [Page 28]

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA                   March 2023


   forwards the lookups to the STA as link-layer unicast frames to let
   the STA answer.  For the data plane, the backbone router acts as a
   normal AP and bridges the packets to the STA as usual.  As a routing
   proxy, the backbone router replies with its own MAC address and then
   routes to the STA at the IP layer.  The routing proxy reduces the
   need to expose the MAC address of the STA on the wired side, for a
   better stability and scalability of the bridged fabric.

5.3.  Case of Mesh Under Technologies

   The Mesh-Under provides a broadcast domain emulation with symmetric
   and Transitive properties and defines a transit link for IPv6
   operations.  It results that the model for IPv6 operation is similar
   to that of a BSS, with the root of the mesh operating as an Access
   Point does in a BSS/ESS.

   While it is still possible to operate ND-Classic, the inefficiencies
   of the flooding operation make the associated operations even less
   desirable than in a BSS, and the use of WiND is highly recommended.

5.4.  Case of DMB radios

   IPv6 over DMB radios uses P2P links that can be formed and maintained
   when a pair of DMB radios transmitters are in range from one another.

5.4.1.  Using ND-Classic only

   DMB radios do not provide MAC level broadcast emulation.  An example
   of that is IEEE Std. 802.11 OCB which uses IEEE Std. 802.11 MAC/PHYs
   but does not provide the BSS functions.

   It is possible to form P2P IP links between each individual pairs of
   nodes and operate ND-Classic over those links with Link-Local
   addresses.  DAD must be performed for all addresses on all P2P IP
   links.

   If special deployment care is taken so that the physical broadcast
   domains of a collection of the nodes fully overlap, then it is also
   possible to build an IP subnet within that collection of nodes and
   operate ND-Classic.

   If an external mechanism avoids duplicate addresses and if the
   deployment ensures the connectivity between peers, a non-transit Hub-
   and-Spoke deployment is also possible where the Hub is the only
   router in the subnet and the Prefix is advertised as not on-link.

5.4.2.  Using Wireless ND

   Though this can be achieved with ND-Classic, WiND is the recommended
   approach since it uses unicast communications which are more reliable
   and less impacting for other users of the medium.

   The routers send RAs with a SLLAO at a regular period.  The period
   can be indicated in the RA-Interval Option [RFC6275].  If available,
   the message can be transported in a compressed form in a beacon,
   e.g., in OCB Basic Safety Messages (BSM) that are nominally sent
   every 100ms.

   An active beaconing mode is possible whereby the Host sends broadcast
   RS messages to which a router can answer with a unicast RA.

   A router that has Internet connectivity and is willing to serve as an
   Internet Access may advertise itself as a default router [RFC4191] in
   its RA messages.  The RA is sent over an unspecified IP link where it
   does not conflict to anyone, so DAD is not necessary at that stage.

   The host instantiates an IP link where the router's address is not a
   duplicate.  To achieve this, it forms a Link-Local Address that does
   not conflict with that of the router and registers to the router
   using [RFC8505].  If the router sent an RA(PIO), the host can also
   autoconfigure an address from the advertised prefix and register it.

       Figure 1: RFC 8505 Registration Flow for a Link-Local Address

   The lifetime in the registration should start with a small value
   (X=RMin, TBD), and exponentially grow with each re-registration to a
   larger value (X=Rmax, TBD).  The IP link is considered down when
   (X=NbBeacons, TDB) expected messages are not received in a row.  It
   must be noted that the physical link flapping does not affect the
   state of the registration and when a physical link comes back up, the
   active registrations (i.e., registrations for which lifetime is not
   elapsed) are still usable.  Packets should be held or destroyed when
   the IP link is down.

   P2P links may be federated in Hub-and-Spoke by edge routers, and the
   Subnet may comprise multiple edge routers, in which case each
   advertises its registered addresses over the Subnet GateWay protocol
   as illustrated in Figure 2.  Note that the Extended DAR/DAC exchange
   can be ommitted if it can be replaced with the information that is
   distributed in the SGP, see for instance [RFC9010] which applies to
   IoT environments, which needs only the first EDAR/EDAC exchange, and
   [EVPN-SFAAC], for EVPN-based wireless deployments in enterprise and
   campus, which does not use EDAR/EDAC at all.

           Figure 3: Initial Registration Flow with 6BBR ND-Proxy

   An example Hub-and-Spoke is an OCB Road-Side Unit (RSU) that owns a
   prefix, provides Internet connectivity using that prefix to On-Board
   Units (OBUs) within its physical broadcast domain.  An example of
   Route-Over MLSN is a collection of cars in a parking lot operating
   RPL to extend the connectivity provided by the RSU beyond its
   physical broadcast domain.  Cars may then operate NEMO [RFC3963] for
   their own prefix using their address derived from the prefix of the
   RSU as CareOf Address.
